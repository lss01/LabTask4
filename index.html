        <p>WHY DO WE GIVE TO CHARITY?</p>
    </div>
    <div id="whyreason">
        <p>When you choose to give, you may not realize that donating to charity will do more than just help your favourite cause, giving can also provide you with many personal benefits. Whether you choose to donate to charities supporting people living in poverty, advocating to protect the environment, helping animals in need, or addressing other global or local problems, charities need your help to continue their selfless initiatives, but giving can feel just as good as receiving!</p>
        <p> PERSONAL VALUES. A SENSE OF MORALITY AND ETHICS<br>96% of people gave to charity as they felt a sense of duty to give back to society and tackle inequality, using their own good fortune to help others.</p>
        <p>BELIEF IN A SPECIFIC CAUSE<br>Almost every donor interviewed identified with a specific cause they felt passionate towards - and for 75% of people this was the key influence behind their giving.<br>The causes that donors supported were varied, with some concerns broader than others - such as international development or the arts - compared to others that were more specifically focused, for example restoring old buildings.<br>Use our charity search to find a cause close to your heart.</p>
        <p>FAITH AND RELIGION<br>Selfless giving is often a key component of many spiritual and religious belief systems and an overwhelming 71% of donors pointed to their religious values as a key motivation for their commitment to charity.</p>
        <p>PERSONAL EXPERIENCES<br>61% of people interviewed spoke of personal, life-changing experiences that sparked their giving. These varied from having directly experienced the hardships of the developing world, to suffering a loss of a family member who battled a disease.<br>The reasons for giving are diverse and most people have more than one influence motivating them to give. Some of the other driving factors for giving included:
            <ul>
                <li> a belief that charities cannot do enough alone</li>
                <li>family</li>
                <li>the satisfaction they get from giving</li>
                <li>determination to leave a positive legacy</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Charitable giving is one way that many people elect to support a specific cause or organization that is close to their heart. From a financial standpoint, charitable giving can be an important part of your estate, tax, and financial planning. In fact, twenty-six percent of taxpayers itemize charitable deductions on their tax return. Depending on the type of your estate, the amount of money you want to give, and how you want to give it, you may find that you’re unsure of what type of charitable giving can work best for you and your philanthropic goals. There are several different ways you can give, each with its own pros and cons, depending on what you’re looking for.</p>
        <p>ORGAN DONATIONS<br>While Black, Asian and minority ethnic consent rates for donation after death have been slowly increasing over the last decade, research shows that families from these communities are far less likely to support donation going ahead than white families. There are a range of reasons for this, and this piece of research by Agroni outlines some barriers and motivations for key groups. </p>
        <p>WHOLE BLOOD DONATION<br>This standard type of donation consists of a donor giving one pint of blood. After the donation, the blood is separated into three different components: red blood cells, plasma and platelets. The actual donation takes 5-10 minutes, extending the overall donation process to 45 minutes. Eligible whole blood donors must be at least 16 years of age, weigh at least 120 pounds and be in general good health. Male donors and female donors 23 years of age and over can donate whole blood every 56 days, up to six times per year. Female donors 16 – 22 years of age can donate every 180 days, up to twice a year.</p>
        <p>CASH<br>A cash gift is the simplest form of charitable giving. Your tax deduction is equal to the amount of cash you donated, minus the value of any goods or services you received in return. For example, memberships to non-profits, like a zoo or some other organization, are considered cash gifts. Titles, certificates, or stocks are not transferred in a cash donation either. The benefit of gifting cash is that it’s incredibly simple to do, and there are no confusing tax deductions or benefits to handle.</p>
        <p>DONOR-ADVISED FUNDS<br>A donor-advised fund is a type of charitable giving where you donate a nonrefundable amount, either in cash or securities, to a nonprofit of your choice. This type of giving accounted for $23.42 billion to charities in 2018 alone.The advantage to this type of giving is that if you feel very close to the cause or organization and want to be involved with how the funds that you give are utilized, you are able to direct the fund’s administrator to which grants you think should be made. You also immediately receive the maximum tax benefit from the IRS for your contribution, and you can set up the funds to continue even after your death.</p>
        <p>REAL ESTATE<br>If you have a property that you’re no longer using and would have to pay a large tax if you sold the property, you may find that donating that real estate to charity is a good option. If you are still living in the property that you’d like to give away, you can set it up to become a charitable contribution by having the deed to your real estate transferred after your death.<br>At that point, the value of the home will be taken out of your estate, lowering your estate taxes. You may also find a great tax benefit by donating real estate. In some cases, you may be eligible for a tax deduction equal to the fair market value of the real estate.</p>
        <p>STOCKS<br>One of the most tax-efficient ways to give is by contributing long-term appreciated securities, like stocks. There are two huge advantages to donating in this way.<br>One, since you are not selling your stocks, there are no capital gains taxes to be concerned with, and the more appreciation the stocks have, the bigger your tax savings will be. The second advantage is that any of your stocks that were purchased over a year ago that have a current value greater than their original cost can be donated and become eligible for a tax deduction equal to the full fair market value of the stock.</p>
